# About

This document shows the steps required to create a GitHub repository, create a site based on it, clone the repository, add content using Visual Study Code and Quatro and push it back to GitHub so the content can be served as an interactive notebook.

# Prerequisites

* Have a [GitHub account](https://github.com) configured so you can connect via SSH (see [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) and [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account), and [Push to GitHub without a password using ssh-key](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14762034/push-to-github-without-a-password-using-ssh-key) in case of errors).
* Install the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) document authoring system.
* Install the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and the [Quarto VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto).

# Creating a repository on GitHub

Go to your [GitHub account](https://github.com), click on the Plus icon (see Figure [GitHub main window](#fig-github)) and create a New Repository (1).

![GitHub main window](Resources/github.webp){.lightbox #fig-github}

Figure [Creating a new repository](#fig-newrepo-empty) shows the page that asks for the new repository information. 
Fill the repository name (2), choose `Add a README file` (3) and choose a license (4).

![Creating a new repository (empty)](Resources/newrepo-empty.webp){.lightbox #fig-newrepo-empty}

Figure [Creating a new repository (filled)](#fig-newrepo-filled) shows the page with the new repository information. Click on the `Create repository` button (5) to create the repository.

![Creating a new repository (filled)](Resources/newrepo-filled.webp){.lightbox #fig-newrepo-filled}

The repository is created and the browser should show its basic information. Now we need to set up a page based on this repository. Click on the `Settings` option (6) in Figure [GitHub page showing the new repository](#fig-repocreated2).

![GitHub page showing the new repository](Resources/repocreated2.webp){.lightbox #fig-repocreated2}

That will bring a page where we can set options for the repository (Figure [Settings for the repository](#fig-settings)). On the left menu, select `Pages` (7). 

![Settings for the repository](Resources/settings.webp){.lightbox #fig-settings}

In the `Source` section (8) chose `Deploy from a branch`, and for `Branch` select `main` and for `folder` choose `docs/`. Options should look like the ones in the figure below. Click on `Save` (9) (see Figure [Page settings for the repository](#fig-pages)). 

![Page settings for the repository](Resources/pages.webp){.lightbox #fig-pages}

Clicking on the repository name should bring you back to the main repository window. 

::: {.callout-note}
In this example the GitHub user name is `rafaeldcsantos` and the repository is `SharingNotebooks`. These are used to compose the remote repository URL:  `https://github.com/rafaeldcsantos/SharingNotebooks.git`. Yours of course will be different; please keep this in mind when creating a repository under your GitHub account.

# Cloning to a local directory 

The steps to clone the project to a local directory are:

1. Make sure your GitHub account allows authentication via ssh: run `ssh -T git@github.com` and see if the output message mentions your username.
1. Change to a base directory, e.g. the one where you keep your projects. 
1. Create a local directory with the same name as your repository (`SharingNotebooks`)
1. Change to this directory. 
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/rafaeldcsantos/SharingNotebooks.git .` -- make sure you have the dot (`.`) at the end of the command, and use **your** remote repository URL. If this command is successfull, the files `LICENSE` and `README.md`, which were created when we created the repository, will be downloaded to the current directory.

# Updating the local files

1. Run the command `touch .nojekyll` or similar -- this will create an empty file named `.nojekyll` to avoid some automation processes on GitHub.
1. Edit the `README.md` just to make some noticeable changes. 
1. Run `git add .` to prepare all new and modified files (but not the deleted files) to upload to GitHub.
1. Run `git commit -m "Your commit message here"` to commit the changes with a comment.
1. Run `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:rafaeldcsantos/SharingNotebooks.git` -- this will update the URL of the remote repository named origin to the specified URL. This command will allow you to push changes to GitHub using ssh.<br> Make sure you use your username and repository name!
1. Run `git push -u origin main` to push the changes to GitHub.
1. Check your repository in GitHub for the changes you did in the file `README.md`.

From that point on, all changes you do to any file in the work directory can be updated with:

1. `git add .`
1. `git commit -m "Add a comment here"`
1. `git push origin main`

# Creating a Quarto Document

Use Visual Code Studio to create a file with extension `.qmd` in the directory we ran the git commands. The `.qmd` file is a pure text file; any editor could be used, I recommend Visual Code Studio since it is a good, free IDE which integrates nicely with Quarto.

Create the file with the menu option 
`File`/`New File`/`Quarto Document`. A simple boilerplate file will be created. 

::: {.callout-note}
Quarto can be used to create complex multi-document HTML pages, interactive notebooks, even presentations. Please refer to [its guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) for examples. For this example we will create a simple page using [Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) and Quarto extensions.
:::

Add some Markdown code to the file and save it with a descriptive filename (in our example, `Intro.qmd`) -- the `.qmd` extension is used for Quarto Markdown files, a variant of Markdown that is specifically designed to work with Quarto. 

Quarto files will be converted to HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which is the markup language for documents that will be displayed in web browsers. In most cases we can to provide additional instructions on how the files will be converted through instructions in a `_quarto.yml` file. 

Create a `_quarto.yml` in the same directory where the `Intro.qmd` is located. Its contents should be:
 
```
project:
  output-dir: docs
```

These instructions basically ensure that all results from the conversion will be stored in the directory `docs` under the working directory. This is the same directory we used as the destination directory for the pages we've set up in GitHub (see Figure [Page settings for the repository](#fig-pages)). 

# yyyy 

Now we need to convert this `.qmd` file to `.html` for displaying in a browser. In Visual Studio Code (see Figure [Converting and displaying `.qmd` files in Visual Studio Code](#fig-runningquarto)) click on the `Preview` button (10). If all Quarto tools are installed correctly and there are no errors on the Markdown file it will be converted to HTML, and success or error messages will be displayed in the terminal (11) and rendered result displayed in the Preview window (12): 

![Converting and displaying `.qmd` files in Visual Studio Code](Resources/VSCode.webp){.lightbox #fig-runningquarto}

Now that we have the `.html` file generated from the `.qmd` file we need to push our project back to GitHub. Just run these commands:

1. `git add .`
1. `git commit -m "Be sure to use meaningful comments"`
1. `git push origin main`

Now open the URL []() to see the rendered file as a GitHub page!

# In case

In this example the GitHub user name is `rafaeldcsantos` and the repository is `SharingNotebooks`. These are used to compose the remote repository URL:  `https://github.com/rafaeldcsantos/SharingNotebooks.git`. Yours of course will be different; please keep this in mind when creating a repository under your GitHub account.
